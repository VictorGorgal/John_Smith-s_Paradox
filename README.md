Inspired by: youtu.be/RFlTawWwLZc

Each game consists of 3 players:

A - Has a box with 6 dice, in which he has to roll at least one 6

B - Has a box with 12 dice, in which he has to roll at least two 6's.

C - There's a box with 18 dice, in which he has to roll at least three 6's.

Are players B and C more likely to win than player A?
